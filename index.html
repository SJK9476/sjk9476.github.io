        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Samuel, or Sam for short. Thanks for taking the time out of
          your day to visit my site, it's currently in it's infancy which I guess makes 
          a lot of sense because so is my journey into the wonderfully frustrating art 
          of coding.<br></br>
          I'll be turning 29 midway through 2023, which in the grand scheme of things is relatively
          young, so why do I feel ready for my free bus pass? A decade in retail will do that to ya.
          The last 10 years have been spent dealing with the disorganisation and
          frustration of a job sector that gives you half the tools and
          double the expectations year on year! So, I finally called it quits and I spent some time
          thinking about the life I wanted, the things I enjoyed and how I can make ther most of my time 
          on this big blue marble hurtling through space. After
          some
          introspection I landed on the tech industry and it's importance to
          every part of life as we know it. It's been staring me in
          the face this whole time. I enjoy methodical work and really
          unraveling a problem.<br></br> So I took the leap and signed up for the
          <strong>Dev30</strong> course offered by the team over at
          Parsity. I got my teeth stuck into some Javascript and really enjoyed
          the experience,
          so my next step was to signup for CodeAcademy Pro and the rest is
          history. <br></br>This site will be a constant work in progress as my knowledge base
          and skillset improves, an ongoing project for me to guage where I'm at and 
          the areas I need to focus on, it's already becoming increasingly apparent that 
          <strong>Google, W3School, CSS-Tricks and MDN </strong> are my new best friends.

        <h3>Helpful Links: Great Resources to Get Started</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Mozilla Developer Network</strong><br></br> A one-stop shop for everything web related, this is a library of
        of reference guides that'll give you a run down on the fundamentals of whichever term, rule or
        language element you're trying to wrap your head around.<br></br>

        <strong>DEV.to - Programmer Community</strong><br></br> Perfect for 'Rookie programmers' and 'Full Stack Engineers' alike, 
        this is an online community for developers to share tips, crowdsource code fixes or just connect
        with like minded people.<br></br>

        <strong>Stack Overflow</strong> <br></br> If you've run into a problem with your code and something just isn't working
        the way you expected you can either search to see if anyones run into the same problem before (99% chance of
        that being the case) or simply state what you're trying to achieve, post your current code alongside it and
        members of the community will offer fixes and context as to why these answers work. My favourite part of SO
        is that they give members the opportunity to vote on the best answer to any particular question - highest voted answer
        stays pinned as the first reply.<br></br>

        <strong>Code Academy Pro</strong> <br></br> I might be a little biased by I personally believe this is the single best resource i've
        relied on while learning to code. There's both a free option and a Pro 'paid subscription' option which will give access to
        courses and curriculums that take you all the way from beginner to full-stack ready. The Pro option gives you the added 
        option of certifications for each new section you master after you pass the exams on subject matter. <br></br>

        <strong>CSS-Tricks</strong><br></br> This is another reference library but the only subject is CSS, if you've got a query about
        how to style your newly written HTML file this is the place to go. Type your CSS query into 'Google' tack CSS-Tricks onto the end
        and away you go.
